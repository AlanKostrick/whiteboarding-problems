# whiteboarding-problems

Here are some different levels for you to choose from...in order to practice. Choose the language of your preference to solve these:

## Lite
- Write a method that takes on a string and adds the first character to the end of the string. For example `Hello` would become `HelloH`
- Write a method that switches the first and last characters in a string. For example `Hello` would become `oellH`
- Write a method that puts a string in reverse. For example `Hello` would become `olleH`

## Medium
- Write a method that counts the number of even numbers in the array `nums`. For example `nums{1,2,3,4,5,6}` would return a value of 3.
- Write a method that counts the number of vowels in a string. For example `Hello` would return the value 2

## Heavy
- Given an array of ints, return true if the value 3 appears in the array exactly 3 times, and no 3's are next to each other. For example `nums{3,1,3,3}` would return false but `nums{3,1,3,2,3}` would return true
- Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so `{6, 2, 5, 3}` returns `{2, 5, 3, 6}`. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array.
